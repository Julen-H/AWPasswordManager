# AW Password Manager

AW Password Manager is a terminal based password manager developed in C++. The program is still in development process, in a near future the program will encrypt also the passwsords.

In an era where digital security breaches are not just common but expected, the significance of having a strong, secure password cannot be overstated. Passwords are often the first line of defense in protecting personal, financial, and professional information from unauthorized access. Despite this, many individuals continue to use weak, easily guessable passwords, putting their digital lives at risk.

A secure password acts as a robust barrier against hackers and malicious software. It ensures that your private data remains confidential, safeguarding everything from your email accounts to bank details. However, creating and remembering complex passwords can be challenging. This is where our program steps in, offering a solution that not only generates strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts but also stores them in your pc.

AW Password Manager can handle operations like:
- Creating password libraries in your pc
- Generating safe and random passwords
- Visualizing your passwords

## Technical Aspects

The program creates a file where all your passwords will be stored locally. Will ask a master password to authenticate the access and the path where the library will be stored. Each time youre going to execute an option the program will ask the master password of the library to authenticate the access. The program generates passwords using this method:
- Character Set Selection: We start with a comprehensive character set that includes lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+). This diverse range ensures that the passwords are complex and resilient against brute-force attacks.

- Random Number Generation: The core of our secure password generation lies in the use of a high-quality random number generator. We use std::random_device as a seed to initialize an instance of std::mt19937, a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random generator. This combination provides a solid foundation for generating random numbers, which are crucial for selecting random characters from our character set.

- Uniform Distribution: To ensure that each character in our set has an equal chance of being selected, we employ std::uniform_int_distribution. This distribution takes the random numbers generated by our Mersenne Twister and maps them to our character set's range. This uniformity is key to avoiding any biases in the character selection process, contributing to the password's strength.

- Password Construction: The function then iteratively selects a random character from the character set for the length specified by the user. Each character is randomly picked based on the uniform distribution, and appended to the password string until it reaches the desired length.

- Result: The end result is a robust, unpredictable password that combines complexity and randomness, making it an excellent defense against common password attacks, such as dictionary or brute-force methods.

## Installation

To use AW Password Manager you only need to download the program and compile it. For that you only need to have a c/c++ compiler.

In Windows you can get the GCC (MinGW) compiler and make sure you install the c++ compiler.

In Linux you should have already installed the gcc compiler. If you donÂ´t have it you can do this way:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential

Once the compiler is fixed you can use this commands to get the program:

- Create/Go to the directory where you want to clone the repository
- Clone the repository -> git clone https://github.com/Julen-H/AWFileManager or download the source code and extract it there
- Compile it -> g++ -c PasswordManager.cpp and later g++ -o AWPasswordManager main.cpp PasswordManager.o
- Run it -> Windows AWPasswordManager.exe / Linux ./AWPasswordManager
